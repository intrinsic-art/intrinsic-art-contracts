{    \"name\": \"Tack Line Torn\",    \"description\": \"In sailing, a tack line is crucial to the stability and direction of a vessel. When the line breaks, the boat will lose control. What happens next depends on the environment. A harbor breeze among friends could mean a leisurely wandering. A storm alone at sea spells chaos. A stop in port with crew yields an orderly assembly line.\\n\\nTack Line Torn repeats the basic components of line and color to portray the wide range of outcomes that are possible when we lose control.
