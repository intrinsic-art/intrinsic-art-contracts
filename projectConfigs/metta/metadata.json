    "description": "DESCRIPTION:\n\"Metta\" is an exploration of the interconnected world, illustrated by Voronoi tessellations created with signed distance functions.\nThe patterns created in this project reflect life's intricate web, showing how individual entities, distinct yet interconnected, form a cohesive whole. The artwork's animation, driven by interaction between the entities, brings these connections to life, illustrating the dynamic nature of relationships.\nIn addition to the aesthetic display, the project is a metaphorical expression of the Metta philosophy. It invites viewers to contemplate the unseen connections in our lives and recognize the profound interconnectedness of all beings. \"Metta\" seeks to awaken a sense of unity and empathy in its mindful viewers, gently guiding them to appreciate the intricate web of relationships that form the fabric of our collective experience.\nCoded in vanilla JS with love, by Matto.\n\nINTERACTIVITY:\nBy default, \"Metta\" will draw itself in, slow down, and pause. This initial paused state creates the canonical image for the token. The paused state can be toggled by double-clicking on the canvas or by pressing the spacebar. \nHotkeys to interact with the script:\n- \" \" toggles pause\n- \"S\" saves a frame\n- \"<\" and \">\" change the background's brightness\nURL parameters to customize the experience:\n- portrait=true will run the script in a vertical aspect ratio (9x16)\n- continuous=true will bypass the initial automatic pausing mechanism\n- delay=<0-1000> will set the delay in milliseconds between draw cycles (default is 25)",
