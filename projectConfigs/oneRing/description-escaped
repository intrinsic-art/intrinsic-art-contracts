It's just One Ring. There isn't much to it, or is there? How much variety can we find with a simple rotating ring that's formed by even bands of circles? To what extent can varying tone and hue dialogue between each other to create harmonious and unique compositions? With curators given creative leeway to generate their own ring, what emergence will such a simple algorithm provide?\n\n \n \t\nIn One Ring, it's up to you to decide what shape the collection takes. Through an exercise of color balance, you are prompted to explore gradients through single or multiple outputs. You may look for rings that take a harmonious path through hue or tone. You may look for seeds where ring and background contrast nicely. Or maybe, you will discover something else altogether. The ring is yours.\n\nAfter having curated Tyler Hobbs & Indigo's QQL artwork extensively one of the concepts I've studied are single-ring seeds. And that's where a generative artwork, One Ring, begins. It's my homage, my rendition to the QQL algorithm and its nuclear element, the simple yet complex ring.\n\nPress s to save a png, g to save a gif and a number from 0-7 to change the speed.
