{    \"name\": \"One Ring\",    \"description\": \"After curating Tyler Hobbs & Indigo\'s QQL extensively through Year 1 (6 minted QQLs, hundreds of hours spent in the algorithm & millions of outputs generated), for Year 2 of QQL I\'ve been exploring a different QQL concept each month.\\nDuring November, I focused on \\\"studying\\\" single rings. And that\'s where a generative artwork, One Ring, was borne. It\'s my rendition (all original code) to the QQL algorithm and its nuclear element. One ring portrays a single ring in different formats but subtracted enough from QQL that it has its own singular life.\\nYou\'ll find rings in motion with up to 12 bands, unusual ring formation and unseen color combinations.\\nCanvas is adaptable to any resolution and rings will present themselves as a close up and (almost) never in full.\\nThrough Intrinsic, collectors will be able to generate their \\\"One Ring\\\" by choosing colors that represent them, inspire them or that simply create a beautiful ring.  \\nPress s to save a png, g to save a gif and a number from 0-7 to change the speed.\",    \"artistName\": \"Heeey\",    \"website\": \"https://exploringqql.com/#one-ring\",    \"license\": \"NFT License\",    \"scriptLibrary\": \"p5.js@1.0.0\",    \"aspectRatio\": \"1:1\"}
